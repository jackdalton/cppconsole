# cppConsole [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jackdalton/cppconsole.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jackdalton/cppconsole)
My own little faux terminal written in C++, for Linux.

To use this, [download everything](https://github.com/jackdalton/cppconsole/archive/master.zip), and run `run.sh`. cppConsole will be compiled, and run.
