# jConsole [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jackdalton/jconsole.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/jackdalton/jconsole)
My own little faux terminal written in C++, for Linux.

To use this, [download everything](https://github.com/jackdalton/jconsole/archive/master.zip), and run `run.sh`. jConsole will be compiled, and run.
